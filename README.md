# HomeBanking

In this project I tried to create a first program using JavaScript, the main web programming language. The project consists of simulating a Home Banking, 
where the user of the application can see the balance of their account and simulate actions such as withdrawal, deposit and money transfers or payment of services.

By doing this program I was able to put into practice the fundamentals of programming, the common foundations of all programming languages and all the websites that exist.
